The shared dependencies between the files we are generating include:

1. **Package Dependencies**: All files share dependencies defined in the `package.json` file. These include the Next.js framework, TypeScript, and any other libraries that are used across the application.

2. **TypeScript Configuration**: All TypeScript files (`.tsx`) share the configuration defined in the `tsconfig.json` file. This includes compiler options and type checking rules.

3. **Next.js Configuration**: All files share the configuration defined in the `.next/config.js` file. This includes settings for server-side rendering and routing.

4. **React Components**: The React components (`_app.tsx`, `_document.tsx`, `index.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`) share common React and Next.js APIs for defining components, handling props, and managing state.

5. **CSS Modules**: The CSS files (`globals.css`, `Home.module.css`) share common CSS rules and selectors. They also use the CSS Modules methodology, which scopes CSS by automatically creating unique class names.

6. **Public Assets**: The public assets (`favicon.ico`, `vercel.svg`) are shared across the application and can be accessed from any file.

7. **DOM Elements**: The id names of DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use are shared across files. These ids are used to select and manipulate elements in the DOM.

8. **Function Names**: Function names are shared across files. These functions can be event handlers, utility functions, or any other functions that are used in multiple files.

9. **Message Names**: Message names are shared across files. These are used for communication between different parts of the application, such as between components or between the client and server.
